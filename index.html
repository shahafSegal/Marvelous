                <h2>Phase by Phase: A Grand Narrative</h2>
                <p>Divided into distinct phases, the MCU has evolved with each new installment, revealing interconnected storylines, character arcs, and overarching narratives. Each phase culminated in a blockbuster ensemble film that brought together multiple heroes to face an impending threat.</p>
              
                <p>Phase One (2008-2012) introduced iconic characters like Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk, and it all led to "The Avengers" (2012), where Earth's mightiest heroes united to defeat Loki and the alien invasion.

                <p>Phase Three (2016-2019) raised the stakes dramatically, pitting the Avengers against the formidable villain Thanos in "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018) and "Avengers: Endgame" (2019).
